				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Summary</b>: Rejected by his entire family, Julian of Macedon basically grew up on the Spartan battlefields, training to become a soldier. In spite of earning status as Athena's greatest general, he led a tragic and unfulfilled life. Then one day, when it seemed things couldn't get any worse, Julian's own half-brother cursed him to live in a book and be a love-slave for all eternity. Julian can only escape his bleak, dark prison when he is summoned by a woman during the full moon. Then, he must spend the next month satisfying her every sexual fantasy, only to disappear back into the book at the next full moon. Since he can derive no pleasure from these encounters himself, other than the relief of being free from the book for a time, Julian lives a lonely and tortured existence. Over the two thousand years that he has been trapped by this curse, he has learned to suppress his emotions and stopped dreaming of escaping long ago. Until one day, he is summoned by a woman who is unlike any other he has ever met.

Grace Alexander is a kind-hearted sex therapist who lives a rather dull and ordinary life. She is also very lonely, still mourning the deaths of her parents in a tragic accident years before. Grace's best friend, Selena, decides to spice up Grace's life by giving her an unusual birthday gift, an antique book that is reputed to have magical powers. Grace doesn't really believe in such things, but at the stroke of midnight by the light of the full moon, she chants Selena's spell anyway, simply to indulge her friend. When nothing happens, the two friends have a good laugh, and Selena heads home. No sooner has she left though, than a bright flash of light fills Grace's house, and afterward a gorgeous naked man is left in it's place. Grace's first inclination is to scream. Then after the initial shock wears off, she seems more interested in feeding and clothing him than anything else. This turn of events is very confusing to Julian who has never really been treated like a human being since his incarceration in the book.
