				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Summary</b>:In a world where dragons are real and an uneasy truce exists between them and humans, Seraphina is a young woman with a secret. The offspring of a human and a dragon, Seraphina is a musical prodigy whose situation allows her considerable insight into both worlds. But a half human/half dragon isnâ€™t even supposed to be possible, and there is such stigma over the idea of humans and dragons mating that Seraphina must not tell anyone about the dragon scales on her body or the mysterious psychic connection she has with others like her. As the anniversary of the dragon/human treaty approaches, there are many barriers from both species that stand in the way. When a rogue dragon has infiltrated the court putting everyone in danger, Seraphina is in a unique position to figure out what is going on and to do something about it. Fortunately, she also has a lot of people to love and support her. </p>
