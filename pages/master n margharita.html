				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Book Name</b>: The Master and Margharita </p>
				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Author Name</b>: Mikhail Bulgakov</p>
				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Summary</b>: Witty and ribald, the story is just as much a penetrating philosophical work that wrestles with profound and eternal problems of good and evil. It juxtaposes two planes of action—one set in Moscow in the 1930s and the other in Jerusalem at the time of Christ. The three central characters of the contemporary plot are the Devil, disguised as one Professor Woland; the “Master,” a repressed novelist; and Margarita, who, though married to a bureaucrat, loves the Master. The Master, a Christ symbol, burns his manuscript and goes willingly into a psychiatric ward when critics attack his work. Margarita sells her soul to the Devil and becomes a witch in order to obtain the Master’s release. A parallel plot presents the action of the Master’s destroyed novel, the condemnation of Yeshua (Jesus) in Jerusalem.
