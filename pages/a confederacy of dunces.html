				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Book Name</b>: A Confederacy of Dunces </p>
				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Author Name</b>: John Kennedy Toole</p>
				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Summary</b>: The book's title refers to an epigram from Jonathan Swift's essay, Thoughts on Various Subjects, Moral and Diverting: "When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him." Its central character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is an educated but slothful 30-year-old man living with his mother in the Uptown neighborhood of early-1960s New Orleans who, in his quest for employment, has various adventures with colorful French Quarter characters. Toole wrote the novel in 1963 during his last few months in Puerto Rico.</p>
