				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Book Name</b>:Hamlet</p>
				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Author Name</b>:William Shakespeare</p>
				<p style="color: white;"> <b>Summary</b>:The play is set in Elsinore, Denmark, at the royal court of the newly crowned King Claudius. With the throne,
Claudius inherits an imminent threat of attack from neighbouring Norway, whose young Prince Fortinbras is
seeking to avenge the defeat of his father by the former King, Prince Hamlet’s father.
Prince Hamlet is deeply depressed by the sudden death of his father, old Hamlet, and the hasty remarriage of his
mother, Queen Gertrude, to his uncle Claudius.
When the ghost of his father appears to Hamlet informing him that he was murdered by Claudius, and calling
upon him to avenge his death, Hamlet is locked into a dangerous mission he would rather not have been given.
Instead of immediately obeying the father he loved and killing the murderer promptly, Hamlet initially chooses to
feign madness in order to conceal his intentions and steadily becomes paralysed by inaction. He intellectualises
the task and seeks further proof of Claudius’ guilt to the point where he himself is exposed to the murderer and
has virtually signed his own death warrant.
Hamlet is disgusted by the relationship between his mother and uncle. He allows his jaundiced view of what he
considers his mother’s infidelity to taint his attitude to women in general. Consequently, Hamlet abandons his
girlfriend, Ophelia, who later loses her mind and drowns. He accidentally kills her father, the King’s Councillor,
Polonius, when he mistakes him for Claudius.
Claudius now frightened of Hamlet’s madness and fearing for his own safety, convinces Polonius’ son (and
Ophelia’s brother), Laertes, to kill Hamlet.
Finally a duel between Hamlet and Laertes, ends in the deaths of Claudius, Gertrude, Laertes, and Hamlet
himself. The rule of the kingdom of Denmark passes to Fortinbras of Norway
